              Lessons vary between 23 and 35 pounds pounds/euros per lesson. The
              frequency of lessons and the type of lessons determines how much
              is paid. Each lesson lasts for an hour but can be extended based
              on customer preference. Lessons are paid with a subscription model
              monthly through stripe and the more lessons a customer books
              attracts discounts.
